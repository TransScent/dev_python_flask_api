#Dictionarys is same as Object in javaScript and JSON

    # print(orderList)
#Now Lets learn iteration in python lets be for,range and nested for all this are applied on (String list,Dictionarys,tupes)
#Now lets see one by 

#String it will print all the character from string
    # myName="Jayprakash Patel"
    # for item in myName:
    # print(item)
    
# for loop on list

    # #for while itrates allthe elements which are present in the list.
    # #Now lets move to the nested list
    # for item1 in friendList:
    # if item==item1:
    # print(item)

 #range what do you think about range 1 to 5 ok lets say we wants to itreate thinks again and again like my name
 #range basically a function which take parameters such as starting and end point which shown below.we can also use nested range.
    # for item in range(5):
    # for item in range(2,5):

    # print(orderList[key])
 #NOW LETS DO SOME FUN HERE 
    #Suppose we wants to check data type of any varible what we will do.For that we have type() function in python we helps alot we dealing we rest data beco we don't konw what type data is coming for server
    # name="Jayprakash"
    # it will print str class it means its type of String
    # print(type(name))
    # Same we can checks every datas type using type() 
    #In python when ever we wants to change varible values does't halt us like java or c#,c++ and many more if we learn.
#let's say we have list 
    # nameList=["21","42","e2e","Alamdar Korludag"]
    # nameList1={"order_id":21212}
    # print(type(nameList)==type(nameList1))
    # we can also compare it's type using operator 
#Let Now learn operators and Arithmetic operators
    # Assignment operators(*,-,+,/,%),Comparison operators(=,==,!=,>,<,>=,<=),Logical operators(and,or,not),Identity operators(is,is not),Membership operators(in,not in),Bitwise operators()
